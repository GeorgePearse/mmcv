# Changes Summary: Converting MMCV to Pure PyTorch

## Overview

This project aims to replace all CUDA and C++ implementations in MMCV with pure PyTorch equivalents.
The changes made so far are a first step toward this goal.

## Files Modified

1. **mmcv/utils/ext_loader.py**
   - Added fallback mechanism for when CUDA extensions aren't available
   - Creates a mock module that warns users when CUDA/C++ functions are called

2. **mmcv/ops/nms.py**
   - Replaced CUDA implementation with pure PyTorch version
   - Implemented NMS, Soft-NMS, NMS Match, and Quadrilateral NMS

3. **mmcv/ops/roi_pool.py**
   - Replaced CUDA implementation with pure PyTorch version
   - Reimplemented forward pass
   - Added placeholder for backward pass (will need proper implementation for training)

4. **mmcv/ops/roi_align.py**
   - Replaced CUDA implementation with pure PyTorch version
   - Reimplemented forward pass
   - Added placeholder for backward pass (will need proper implementation for training)

## Files Added

1. **mmcv/ops/pure_pytorch_nms.py**
   - Contains pure PyTorch implementations of NMS operations:
     - `nms_pytorch`: Standard NMS
     - `soft_nms_pytorch`: Soft NMS with linear, Gaussian, or naive mode
     - `nms_match_pytorch`: NMS match for grouping boxes
     - `nms_quadri_pytorch`: NMS for quadrilateral boxes

2. **mmcv/ops/pure_pytorch_roi.py**
   - Contains pure PyTorch implementations of ROI operations:
     - `roi_pool_pytorch`: ROI pooling
     - `roi_align_pytorch`: ROI align with bilinear interpolation

3. **remove_cuda_deps.py**
   - Utility script to find and replace CUDA/C++ implementations
   - Can be extended to handle more operations in the future

4. **pytorch_only_summary.md**
   - Lists all operations that have been converted and those still needing conversion
   - Categorizes operations by type (NMS, ROI, etc.)

5. **README_PYTORCH_ONLY.md**
   - Documentation on how to use and extend the PyTorch-only version
   - Guidelines for implementing missing operations

## Limitations

1. **Backward Passes**: Most operations do not have proper backward pass implementations yet, 
   which means they won't work correctly for training. They should work fine for inference.

2. **Performance**: The pure PyTorch implementations are likely slower than the CUDA-optimized versions.

3. **Numerical Precision**: There may be slight numerical differences in results.

## Next Steps

1. Implement proper gradient computation for backward passes
2. Convert more operations to pure PyTorch
3. Add tests to ensure numerical equivalence with original implementations
4. Benchmark performance to identify areas for optimization
